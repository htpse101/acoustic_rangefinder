ADC Notes

ADC stores results in 16 bit registers 

channel wise programmable sampling time

DMA request generation during conversion




Channel selection
	16 channels
	Regular
	
	Injected

	ADC_CHANNEL_0 for IN0
	
ADC Clock
	Analog clock = ADCCLK
		ADCCLK = APB2 divided by 2/4/6/8
	Digital Clock
	
Timing
	ADC requires 15 ADC clock cycles to stabalize, after it has been turned on to auto conversion mode.

Scan mode
	scans multiple channels.
	
Channel-wise Programmable Sampling Time
	Conversion time Tconv = sampling time + 12 cycles
	ADCCLK = APB2	/2/4/6/8
	
Conversion on External Trigger and Trigger polarity
	It's possible to trigger on a timer rather than using the other things.

	
Using DMA
	If data is lost, OVR flag is set and conversions and requests halt
